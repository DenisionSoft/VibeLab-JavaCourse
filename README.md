# Solutions of tasks from VibeLab Java marathon

This repository is a mirror of the `vibelab-heap3-backend` group of repositories on my GitLab (that may be deleted one day).

There you can find solutions to various tasks from JavaCore to SpringBoot. <br>
Each task is in a separate folder, and each folder has a README.md file with a description of the task and files with solutions.

The VibeLab Java marathon covered a wide range of topics, from basic Java syntax to launching a RESTful Spring application with Gradle, JPA and a PostgreSQL database.
